# Alias Update Summary

## ✅ **Alias Successfully Updated**

The `yap` alias has been updated to use the new launcher script that automatically detects and closes running instances.

3. **🔄 Close** existing instances gracefully
4. **🚀 Start** a new clean instance
5. **✅ Report** success or any issues
