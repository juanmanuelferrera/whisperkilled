The applications of AI span across numerous industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. In healthcare, AI is being used for medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans. Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, has been particularly transformative. Deep learning algorithms can process vast amounts of data and identify patterns that would be impossible for humans to detect. This capability has led to breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics."""
